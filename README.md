# bookmarks


<h2> Project Idea </h2>

This goal of this project is to allow users to create bookmarks of notes from books they are currently reading to highlight important chapters and sections.


<h2>User Story</h2>

A user will be able to create a new 'bookmarks' for books they are currently reading. It will then allow them to go into each book and create 'chapters' and within each chapter, create individual 'pages' of notes that they want to highlight – this can be important takeaways from textbooks or personal reading.
